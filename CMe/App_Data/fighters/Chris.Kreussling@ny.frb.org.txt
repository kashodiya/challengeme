I'm in charge of Development Services, part of Common Services, for the NY Central IT Development organization. My primary job responsibility is improving the development process. I keep abreast of good development practices through membership in professional organizations, reading hundreds of pages a week in magazines and online journals, and continually honing my own development practices and refining my craft.

Background 

I've been programming in one form or another since 1973. My first language was Basic, my storage medium: paper tape. Other languages I've programmed in over the years include Fortran, Assembler, COBOL, Exec, Rexx, Java, PHP, and limited Perl, as well as various scripting languages. (There's a long list of other alphabet soup, including XML, UML, ITIL, SQL, ...) Common themes throughout my professional career have been process improvement, automation, tool-building and knowledge-sharing.
