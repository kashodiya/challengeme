Since transferring from National Information Security Assurance (NISA), I have been a Senior Enterprise Architect within Enterprise Architecture (EA) focusing on collaboration, information security and identity and access management.  My responsibilities span from managing the enterprise review of the FR collaboration platform to performing Program Management responsibilities for the FR PIV Program and PKI Strategy.   Prior to this, responsibilities included building the architecture for the Access Management Program and leading the Two-Factor Authentication Program and roadmapping activities.  In my previous career outside of the System, I worked as a business architect with a consultant company in New York focuses solely on the financial service industry.
