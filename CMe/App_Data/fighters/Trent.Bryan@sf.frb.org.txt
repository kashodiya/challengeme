My interests include travel, snowboarding, fishing,camping, hiking, and basically anything that gets me outdoors.  My wife and I have a 6 year old daughter that keeps us busy trying to keep up with her social schedule.  I have been working for the bank since 2005, all of my time being spent in Cash Services.  Prior to this I worked for Bank of America and MGMMirage Resorts.  I have 20 years of management experience in operations with these companies.
