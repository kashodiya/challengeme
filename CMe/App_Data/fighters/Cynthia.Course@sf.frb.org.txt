I started working for the San Francisco Fed in May 2011, following 17 years at the Philadelphia Fed. I work in the Risk Coordination Unit and oversee guidance dissemination and implementation for the Division. I also am actively involved in outreach actvities, speaking regularly to bankers, educators, and other members of the public on banking conditions and what we do in MS&R. Also, given my rotation to the Board in 2011 to work on SLHC issues, I am one of the go-to people for SLHCs. Finally, special projects are my specialty! While in Philly, I was one of the officers over the community banking area, with both examination teams and portfolios of institutions under me. I also served as the officer over enforcement and the administrative officer for five years each.  When I'm not working, I enjoy all that Arizona has to offer. I spend a lot of my down time with my horse, riding him almost every day that I'm not in travel status. My husband and I also like to vacation throughout the west, including Hawaii!
