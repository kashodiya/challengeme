I oversee the Division's Risk Monitoring & Analysis Group which is comprised of three Units (Risk Coordination Unit, Surveillance & Analysis Unit, and Risk Analytics and Monitoring), and I report to Teresa Curran.   I have just passed my 15 year anniversary with the Fed in San Francisco which spans approximately 26 years - starting in 1987 as an Assistant Examiner and left the Bank in 1993 to work in the financial services industry (KPMG, Providian Financial and Washington Mutual).   I returned to the Bank in 2006 and have been in my current role since 2010.
