I joined the Division in 1979 as an analyst in the Financial Analysis unit, which at the time was the rough equivalent of our current SAU.  Due to some turnover, I soon moved to the applications area and have continued to be associated with this business line during most of my tenure here.  Over the years, I also managed several other units which were sister units of Applications under various versions of the Division organization chart, including financial analysis, surveillance, regulatory reporting (now resides in Accounting) and enforcement (currently).  Also, in recent years I have assumed leadership for the Division's outreach and industry engagement program, which has taken on increased importance as reflected by the initiative's designation as a key priority under the Division's strategic plan. While I've been here a long time, the work has always seemed challenging and diverse.  Having gone through several economic downturns and with significant new banking legislation seemingly every few years (though nothing that compares with Dodd-Frank!), I can say that the Fed has truly been an interesting place to work.
