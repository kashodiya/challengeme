Baby boomer Army brat, born in Heidelberg, Germany and grew up mostly in Northern VA and Texas.  Graduated from high school in El Paso, TX and college, Baylor University (Sic'em Bears!) in beautiful central wacky Waco, Tx. First job as credit officer in training at RepublicBank, Houston, worked for several banks in Houston and moved to Dallas, working for Bank of America.   Joined FRB Dallas in mid 80s.....ugh that was way too long ago, painful to remember!  Commissioned commercial, bhc, and FBO examiner at Dallas FED during the southwest financial crisis. Transferred to LA Branch of SF Fed in 1992, now 20 years ago, how did that happen?!?!?  Have had lots of positions, team leader, portfolio manager, people manager, field examiner, and worked in numerous units, FBO, Domestic exam, LFI (BNPP and MUFG) and now working in the Risk Coordination Unit reporting to Wally Young. Crave new ideas  and really enjoy being challenged with differing points of view, like to see the full picture! Ask me what has been my favorite job of all at the Fed and outside the Fed, dare you.
