I believe the single most significant decision I can make on a day-to-day basis is my choice of attitude. It is more important than my past, my education, my bankroll, my successes or failures, fame or pain, what other people think of me or say about me, my circumstances, or my position. Attitude keeps me going or cripples my progress. It alone fuels my fire or assaults my hope. When my attitudes are right, there is no barrier too high, no valley too deep, no dream too extreme, no challenge too great for me. I have been working for FRBSF- Los Angeles branch for 17 yrs. Started in the Cash Department as a cash processor.  Transferred to BSR in 2000 as a Staff Assistant.  A year later, I got the Project Analyst position in ESU. I supported various stakeholders as well as managed multiple projects.  In June 2012, I was promoted to Associate Manager and is responsible for 6 Project Analysts within our unit.
