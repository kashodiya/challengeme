I was born in Columbia, South Carolina but spent most of my life in the Bay Area where I live today. Growing up I was heavily involved in various organized sports but gravitated toward the game of tennis where I had some limited success. My first computer was a Commodore Vic 20 with 5 kilobytes of RAM storage which is approximately 0.000004768 of a gigabyte.
