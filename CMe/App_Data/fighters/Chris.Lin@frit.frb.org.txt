FRIT unix systems administrator supporting WPO (wholesale product office)

i bought my wife an iphone...but she says i use it more than she does :p

Don't consider myself a runner but I run.  

pet peeve - bad UI (user interfaces)

I don't believe one can truly multi-task...one merely, in OS terms, context-switches...and doing too much of that in short intervals isn't productive unless one is doing some mindless assembly-line work...which is why i put on the headphones while i wash the dishes.

 Some people call me "Lin", but I prefer "Chris" ;).
