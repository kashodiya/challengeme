Since 2001, I have enjoyed traveling throughout the 12th District as an examiner.  Now, I serve as one of the Associate Examiner Development Program managers in Los Angeles.     While I have been lucky enough to visit most of the banks in our District, the new associates and examiners will miss some of the most colorful banks/cities in our district: El Centro, CA - Just north of the Mexico border - east of San DiegoLa Jolla, CA - Just north of San DiegoEphraim, UT - 3 hours south of Salt Lake CityKaysville, UT - 1.5 hours north of Salt Lake CityLogan, UT - 3 hours north of Salt Lake CityCasa Grande, AZ - Just south of PhoenixScottsdale, AZ - Just east of PhoenixLas Vegas, NV - We did have at least three banks there at one time!Grants Pass/Florence, OR - Five hours north of the Sacramento Airport (We drove it!)Plus, while I have gotten to visit mostl of the states in our District, we can only hope that one day we have a bank in Alaska!
