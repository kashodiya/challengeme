I currently make my contribution to BS&R as the Manager of the Quality Assurance Unit and Chair of the System's Quality Assurance Community of Practice.  I'm a believer in staff development and that we can be at our best when we operate with intention versus being told specifically to how to accomplish a task.    My background includes work in the field of consumer compliance and a short period of time as a financial analyst in the Surveillance and Analysis Unit.  I possess a BA in Economics from the State University of New York at Albany and a certificate in Banking from the Pacific Coast Banking School.   At home, I'm the proud father of my five year old daughter and super duper problem solver, Tess and my three-year old, truck-loving son, Matthew. My wife Christiane also works at the FRB in the Consumer Compliance area.
