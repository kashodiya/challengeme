I have 10 years experience primarily in Lotus Notes/Domino development and administration with a few other technologies like BlackBerry and Plumtree/BEA AquaLogic enterprise web portal thrown in for good measure. I currently work for GLC Wireless, a great team of people dedicated to maintaining and enhancing the wireless experience for the Fed.
